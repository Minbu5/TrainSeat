# General idea
# When travel with tran 3rd class there is always question where is my seat? Is at window or not?
# This off course can be adjusted during buy process, but let's say you forgot.
# Make small app that could be run on multiple platforms mobile android
# that can tell you where is your seat is at window, in the middle or at passage
